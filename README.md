## 📌 Overview

**Llama4-Vision-Analyzer** is a multimodal AI web application that allows users to upload an image and analyze it using two Llama 4 Vision models. By combining image input with natural language prompts, the system generates context-aware responses that demonstrate visual understanding and reasoning. Built with FastAPI and API-based model integration, this project showcases practical skills in full-stack development, multimodal AI integration, and comparative evaluation of large Vision-Language Models in a real-world deployment setting.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project was built to demonstrate:

- Multimodal (image + text) AI integration
- Vision-Language Model (VLM) API usage
- Backend API communication
- Image preprocessing and encoding
- Clean project structuring for deployment
- Model comparison between Scout and Maverick

---

## 🧠 Models Used

The application supports the following Llama 4 Vision-Instruct models:

- `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
- `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`

These models support:

- Image + text input
- Visual reasoning
- Contextual explanation
- Visual question answering (VQA)

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 Backend (FastAPI)

- Built using **FastAPI** for high-performance asynchronous API handling
- REST endpoint (`/upload_and_query`) for image + prompt processing
- Image validation using **Pillow (PIL)**
- Base64 image encoding for multimodal API formatting
- Secure API key management using **python-dotenv**
- Structured error handling with `HTTPException`
- Logging integration for request tracking and debugging

---

### 🎨 Frontend (HTML + TailwindCSS)

- Responsive UI built with **TailwindCSS**
- Dynamic image preview before submission
- JavaScript `fetch()` API for asynchronous requests
- Markdown response rendering using **Marked.js**
- Dual-response layout for side-by-side model comparison
- Interactive error handling and loading states

---

### 🧠 Multimodal AI Integration

- Integration with **Llama 4 Scout (17B MoE)**
- Integration with **Llama 4 Maverick (128E MoE)**
- Image + text combined into structured multimodal message format
- Comparative response generation from two Vision-Language models
- Configurable token limits and inference settings

## 📊 Results

The application was tested using dermatology-style image prompts to evaluate how effectively the two Vision-Language models interpret visible skin conditions and generate structured explanations. The examples below demonstrate the complete workflow — from image upload to comparative model responses.

---

### 🔹 Input Interface (Acne Image Upload)

The user uploads an acne-affected facial image and provides a prompt such as:

> *"Analyze this skin condition and describe possible characteristics and observations."*

The interface allows seamless image upload and prompt entry, preparing the multimodal input for processing by the selected Vision model.

---

### 🔹 Model Response (Llama 4 Scout)

The Scout model generates a structured response describing visible skin characteristics such as inflammation, lesion distribution, redness patterns, and surface texture. The output demonstrates strong visual grounding and context-aware reasoning based on the uploaded image.

---

### 🔹 Model Response (Llama 4 Maverick)

<img width="666" height="920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6e36d70-7fef-4e9c-8a24-90558ee79b3b" />


The Maverick model provides a more detailed interpretation, often expanding on lesion morphology, severity indicators, and broader contextual observations. This enables side-by-side comparison of reasoning depth, clarity, and descriptive detail between the two models.

---

### 🧠 Observations

- Both models successfully identify visible acne-related features.
- Responses demonstrate strong visual-text alignment.
- The comparative setup highlights differences in reasoning style and explanation depth.
- The system performs effectively for educational skin-condition analysis demonstrations.
